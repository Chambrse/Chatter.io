# Chatter.io
Have you ever been live streaming an important event or popular streamer on facebook or twitch and tried to participate in chat? If there are a lot of people, the chat goes by so fast that you can't keep up; let alone hold a back and forth conversation with someone else in the room.

The purpose of this project is to experiment with alternative chat user interfaces that allow for easier readability, less wasted space, and enhanced reply and thread management functionality.
